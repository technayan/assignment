1. What the simple List component does?
Ans: The simple List component returns the list under an unordered list. The list items have some style. The background of the list item is red. Every list item also has a click event, on clicking the list item's background changes to green.

2. What problem / warnings are there with code?
Ans: There are some mistakes in the code. On the setting of propTypes of WrappedListComponent instead of shapOf it would be shape. Because shapeOf is producing a TypeError as shapeOf is not a function and it does not belong to 'prop-types' package. In the same line instead of array it would be arrayOf. Because it is creating an Invariant Violation error: Calling PropTypes validators directly is not supported by the 'prop-types' package. On the setting of propTypes of WrappedSingleListItems the PropTypes of isSelected would be number. As we are passing index(number) using useState so, it is creating a Failed to prop type error. On <ul> when we map the items and render the SingleListItems component then we should pass a key property of a unique number. Inside the WrappedListComponent While creating an state using useState we should declare it as const[selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex]= useState(). The style of the list(<li>) inside the WrappedSingleListItem should be styled as style={{ backgroundColor: isSelected === index ? 'green' : 'red'}}
